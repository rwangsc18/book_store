# book_store
This project implements an app for users to store a list of books. The main script is app.py which provides a user interface and asks for user's input for adding a new book, listing all books, marking a book as read, and deleting a book.
 
The original version uses in-memory storage list to host the information about the books.
 
The 2nd version saves the list of books to an external CSV txt file.

The 3rd version saves the list of books to an external JSON file.

The latest version uses the SQL database with sqlite3.
